# Scarpet_Bot_Summoner
A scarpet script that helps server admins to limit the bot numbers each player can spawn

Use `/bot summon bot_name` and `/bot kick bot_name`

Make sure the following rules are properly set:  
`CommandPlayer` is set to `ops`  
`ScriptsAutoload` is set to `True`  
`allowSpawningOfflinePlayers` is set to `True`  

You can change global_spawning_limit and 
global_summon_prefix in the begining of the script file

Enjoy!
